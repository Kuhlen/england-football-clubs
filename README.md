# England Football Clubs

A modern Single Page Application (SPA) built with Svelte 5, featuring English football club data and designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## 🚀 Overview

This application serves as a comprehensive learning project for exploring Svelte 5's capabilities while creating a functional football club information platform. The app fetches and displays data about English football clubs in an intuitive, responsive interface.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as a personal learning initiative to master Svelte UI library fundamentals and modern web development practices. It demonstrates practical implementation of various frontend technologies and design patterns.

## ✨ Features

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Installable and works offline
- **Single Page Application**: Smooth navigation without page reloads
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live English football club information
- **Modern UI**: Clean and professional interface design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Svelte 5**: Modern reactive framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Yarn**: Package manager
- **Custom Router**: Hand-built SPA routing system

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project encompasses several key learning areas:

- **Custom SPA Router**: Built from scratch routing system
- **Component Architecture**: Modular and reusable component design
- **State Management**: Svelte stores implementation
- **Local Storage**: Client-side data persistence
- **UI/UX Design**: Modern interface design principles
- **Code Organization**: Clean, maintainable code structure

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows modern frontend architecture principles:

- **Component-based Structure**: Modular components for better maintainability
- **Store Pattern**: Centralized state management using Svelte stores
- **Custom Routing**: Self-implemented SPA routing for learning purposes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS
